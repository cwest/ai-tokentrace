# Implementation Plan: GenAI Cost Observability Library (`ai-tokentrace`)

## Overview
This document is the master implementation plan for the `ai-tokentrace` library. It outlines the phased approach to development, with each phase corresponding to a detailed "epic" plan.

This master plan provides a high-level overview of the project's epics and the logical order of their execution. For detailed tasks, refer to the individual epic documents.

## Project Epics
The implementation is broken down into the following epics, which are designed to be executed sequentially:

1.  **[Epic 1: Scaffolding & Foundation](./epics/00-01-scaffolding-and-foundation.md)**
    -   **Focus:** Establish the project structure, development tooling, and foundational code.
    -   **Outcome:** A well-structured, empty project with a configured development environment, CI, and core data models.

2.  **[Epic 2: Core Service Implementation](./epics/00-02-core-service-implementation.md)**
    -   **Focus:** Build the core data export functionality.
    -   **Outcome:** A fully functional and tested `TokenUsageService` with all required backend implementations.

3.  **[Epic 3: `google-genai` Integration](./epics/00-03-google-genai-integration.md)**
    -   **Focus:** Implement tracking for direct `google-genai` library calls.
    -   **Outcome:** A working `TrackedGenaiClient` that captures and exports token usage data.

4.  **[Epic 4: ADK Integration](./epics/00-04-adk-integration.md)**
    -   **Focus:** Implement tracking for the Agent Development Kit (ADK).
    -   **Outcome:** A `TokenTrackingPlugin` and granular callbacks for seamless ADK integration.

5.  **[Epic 5: CI/CD and Documentation](./epics/00-05-ci-cd-and-documentation.md)**
    -   **Focus:** Finalize the project's automation, documentation, and release readiness.
    -   **Outcome:** A fully documented, tested, and distributable library with an automated release pipeline.

## Execution
To begin implementation, start with the first epic and proceed in order. Each epic document contains the specific, actionable tasks required for its completion.
